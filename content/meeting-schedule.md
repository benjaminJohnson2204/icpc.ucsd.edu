# Meeting Schedule

Our weekly meeting day/time for Fall Quarter 2024 is TBD. We will hold a poll during Week 0 to decide on the meeting time. Please [join our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/ucsdcp/signup) to participate in the poll.

<!-- In Fall Quarter 2024, weekly meetings will be **every Tuesday from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at CSE basement B260**. At each meeting, we learn and practice a new algorithm/data structures concept through practice competition problems. -->
