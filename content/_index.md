Welcome to the Competitive Programming (CP) Club at UC San Diego! We are a student organization devoted to helping programmers excel in problem-solving techniques involving computer algorithms and data structures, as well as engaging in various algorithmic programming competitions.

# Overview

The [International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest) is a team-based yearly programming competition. Universities from all over the world participate, with top teams advancing to the prestigious World Finals. As the oldest and largest programming contest in the world, ICPC holds a significant reputation. For a glimpse into past competitions, check out the ICPC introduction video: [ICPC_News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBabBbxPE7w). Our team competes in the [SoCal ICPC region](http://socalcontest.org/current/index.shtml), and teams can advance to the
[North America Championship](https://nac.icpc.global/) and eventually to the [World Finals](<(https://icpc.global/)>).
